# udacity-nlp-nanodegree

This repository houses Jupyter Notebook files containing projects for the Udacity Natural Language Processing Nanodegree course, which I completed in June 2020. There are 3 main projects, with the VUI Speech Recognizer being the capstone. All helper files, data sets and trained model parameter files for inference are included. Code frameworks are provided by Udacity with my own personal contributions generally indicated with TODO markers.
